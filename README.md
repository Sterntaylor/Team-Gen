## Team-Generator repo
    Week 10 Project, Team-Generator with node.js

    We used the following NPMs
        -Jest for testing
        -Inquirer for prompts
        -Axios for http requests and transforming JSON data
        -FS to read, create, upload, deletion, and renaming files
        
        This week we were tasked with creating, what I imagined as a HR/Admin tool for adding new hires to a 
        generated website after information was gathered and input.

I used many, many gudelines to be able to produce this project. However one error
I couldn't solve was having undefined as some values. I tried editing my .test files
but if they weren't set to undefined they did not pass the test. I looked through all the other
code in /lib files and looked over my index.js file many times but I could not find the error as to why 
I got undefined for Office Number and GitHub Username but not for School name.
